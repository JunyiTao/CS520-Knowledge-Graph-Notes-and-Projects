- examples requiring  change
    - Changing world: Amazon Product Knowledge Graph
    - Changing requirements: Google Knowledge Graph
    - Changing sources (Google Knowledge Graph)
    - Changes affecting previous inferences:
        - Consider the constraint that a movie theater only shows movies
        •Using this constraint a KG might have previously inferred that certain events are movies
        - More recently the movie theaters are being used for operas, and social events
        •If we had previously derived such events to be movies, we must update them
    - Changes requiring redesign
- change management techniques
    - schema evolution
        - For a relational database
            - Adding/removing a column, renaming an attribute
        - For a knowledge graph

            Approach is to maintain invariants, and make system-specific decisions

            - Adding/removing a class
            - Adding/removing a superclass
            - Adding/removing a property
            - Adding/removing a constraint
    - view maintenance

        A mechanism from databases to name a query
        •Query is defined with respect to one or more tables (known as base tables)
        •If we store the results of the query, the stored data is called materialized view

        - If the base data changes, the materialized view must be updated
    - truth maintenance

        A mechanism from rule-based systems
        •Tracks how each conclusion was derived

        - A popular implementation: Justification based system

            •Each derived conclusion records the fact or rule that was used in derivation
            •Any time that fact or rule updates, the conclusion must be revised
