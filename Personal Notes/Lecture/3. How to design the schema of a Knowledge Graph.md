## KEYS
- Common considerations
  - Choice of classes and relations
  - Reification and handling higher arity relationships
- RDF knowledge graph design driven by
  - Use over the WWW
  - Reuse of vocabularies
  - Linking data
- Property Graph design driven by
  - Optimizing query performance
> Even though there are some guidelines to design, there are also equivalent good choices.


## Outline

- KG
- create KG
    - design schema
        - design RDF graph
            - linked data principles
                - use IRI as names of things
                    - identify the items of interest
                    - short and pneumonic
                    - ensure persistence
                - Use HTTP IRIs
                    - people can lookup (dereferencing) things
                - provide useful information in RDF/SPARQL
                    - dereferencing of a non-information object returns RDF data
                    - if must create new vocabulary, ensure...
                        - documented, self-describing, visioning policy, defined in multiple languages, published by trusted sources
                - Include links to other URIs
                    - relationship links
                        - <foaf:based_near>
                        - relate object in one dataset to an object in another
                    - identity links
                        - <owl:sameAs>
                        - equate object in one dataset to objects in another
                    - vocabulary links
                        - <rfbs:subClassOf>
                        - links from the data to the definition of terms
        - design property graph
            - choosing nodes, labels, and properties
            - when to introduce relationships
                - when efficient access is required
            - when to introduce a relationship property
                - common use cases for relationship properties
                    - time varying relationships
                    - provenance
                    - confidence
                - disadvantages
                    - Many systems do not index on relationship properties
                    - This may not be a problem if relationship properties are used in the last stage of query processing
                    - For performance sensitive queries, it is better to reify the relationship
    - populating
- reason with and access KG
