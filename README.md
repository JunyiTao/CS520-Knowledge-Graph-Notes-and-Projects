## About
Knowledge graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for organizing world's structured knowledge over the internet, capturing relationships among key entities of interest to enterprises, and a way to integrate information extracted from multiple data sources. Knowledge graphs have also started to play a central role in machine learning and natural language processing as a method to incorporate world knowledge, as a target knowledge representation for extracted knowledge, and for explaining what is being learned. This class is a graduate level research seminar and will include lectures on knowledge graph topics (e.g., data models, creation, inference, access) and invited lectures from prominent researchers and industry practitioners. The seminar emphasizes synthesis of AI, database systems and HCI in creating integrated intelligent systems centered around knowledge graphs.
 
### Previous Edition
This seminar was also offered during Spring 2020. The playlist of all the session videos from the previous edition is available here.

### Seminar Format
The seminar will be offered over Zoom as per the planned schedule. The sessions will be recorded, and the recordings posted here as and when they become available.
There will be two sessions each week. One of the sessions is based on the synthesis of the key points from the Spring 2020 series. The second session will feature invited speakers from academia and industry.
Stanford students taking the course for credit will be required to complete 10 online quizzes through Canvas, and submit a written summary of any eight of the invited guest sessions.
